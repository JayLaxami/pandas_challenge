Note: school_data_to_load is the path to the respective schools_complete.csv
      student_data_to_load is the path to the respective students_complete.csv
      Right now, both are under "Resources" relative to the parent directory 
      While testing code, make sure the dataset path is provided correctly.

  - We got math and reading scores for 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th graders.
  - Schools with higher spending per student ($645-680) underperformed as compared to smaller spending per student(<$585).
  - Small(<1000) and Medium sized (1000-2000) schools performed better than large schools.
  - Also, it is clearly seen from calculation that Charter School performed much better than District School. 
  
2.**Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations:**
  - Charter School performed better for all the scores of math, reading and overall than District School.
