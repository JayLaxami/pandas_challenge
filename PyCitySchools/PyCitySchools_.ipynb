    "        Performance calculated on basis of average Math and reading score and their percentage and also overall rate.\n",
    "        We got top school on basis of thier score which is Cabrera High School which is a charter school.\n",
    "        We got math and reading scores for 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th graders.\n",
    "        Schools with higher spending per student (645−680) under performed as compared to smaller spending per student (<585).\n",
    "        Small(<1000) and Medium sized (1000-2000) schools performed better than large schools.\n",
    "        Also, it is clearly seen from calculation that Charter School performed much better than District School.\n",
